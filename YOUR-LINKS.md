## 🎯 What's Happening Now

I've created a **v1.0.0 release tag** and pushed it to GitHub.

GitHub Actions is now automatically building:
- ✅ Windows Installer (.exe)
- ✅ Windows Portable (.exe)
- ✅ macOS DMG (Intel)
- ✅ macOS DMG (Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Linux AppImage
- ✅ Linux .deb
- ✅ Linux .rpm

**This will take about 10-15 minutes.**

### Check Build Progress
Go to: https://github.com/federico1234908/software-amp-studio/actions

You'll see the "Build and Release" workflow running. When it completes, all installers will be available for download!

---

## 🌐 Your Website Download Links

Your website ([public/software.html](public/software.html)) now has working download buttons:

- **Primary Button**: "Usa Web App" → Opens the web version (works immediately!)
- **Secondary Button**: "Scarica Desktop" → Links to your GitHub Releases page

Users clicking "Scarica Desktop" will go to:
```
https://github.com/federico1234908/software-amp-studio/releases/latest
```

Where they can download the installer for their platform.
